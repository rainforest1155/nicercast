nodecast
========

Simple node.js icecast compliant streaming server. Instead of outputting a MP3 via LAME, this fork is outputting a WAV file with raw pcm audio in an attempt to save CPU when streaming on slow devices.

Based off work done by [TooTallNate](https://github.com/tootallnate) on [NodeFloyd](https://github.com/TooTallNate/NodeFloyd).
